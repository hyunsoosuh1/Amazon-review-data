# Amazon Review data

This code uses of the reviews data for "Movies/TV" and "Books" category from the Amazon review data (Ni, 2018). 

The first step is data preprocessing, setting review ID as the primary key and movies/tv and books set as the columns with the respective ratings. 

The second step consists of data analysis, comparing:
1) The distribution of mean difference in rating between movies/tv and books
2) The distribution of proportion difference in 5 ratings between movies/tv and books
3) The distribution of proportion difference in extreme ratings (1 or 5) between movies/tv and books.

The third step explains some limitations of the dataset on the relationship between the two categories when comparing the ratings of movies and books the movies were based on. 

Lastly, a short potential follow-up analysis is suggested to further experiment with the datasets.
